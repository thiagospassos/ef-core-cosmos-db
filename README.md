# Getting Started with Cosmos Db with Entity Framework Core

This repository was originally created to support this [blog post](https://passos.com.au/ef-core-cosmos-db), but since then a lot of changes happened and the [original nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Cosmos.Sql/2.2.0-preview2-35157
) was discontinued and now I'm relying on the [new one](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Cosmos)

This code base is a very simple example on how to set up EF Core to talk to Cosmos DB and how the different options are put together.
